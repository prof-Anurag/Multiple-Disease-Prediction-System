# Project Title: Multiple Diseases Prediction System

The **Multiple Diseases Prediction System** is a machine learning-based web application developed using **Streamlit**. This system predicts the likelihood of several major diseases — including **Parkinson's Disease**, **Breast Cancer**, **Diabetes**, and **Heart Disease** — based on user-provided medical data. Each condition is handled by a separate predictive model, trained on real-world datasets and evaluated for accuracy and performance.

The application features a clean, interactive interface where users can enter relevant health metrics and receive instant disease predictions. This project demonstrates how machine learning can be combined with modern web technologies to create accessible and impactful tools for early health screening and awareness.

## Skills Used

- **Machine Learning**: Model training, testing, and evaluation using algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.
- **Python Programming**: Data preprocessing, model implementation, and backend logic.
- **Streamlit**: Creating an interactive and user-friendly web application.
- **Pandas & NumPy**: Data manipulation and analysis.
- **Scikit-learn**: Machine learning model development and evaluation.
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn** *(optional)*: Data visualization (if used).
- **Problem Solving & Critical Thinking**: Designing an end-to-end prediction pipeline and integrating multiple models into one system.


## Summary

The **Multiple Diseases Prediction System** is a Streamlit-based machine learning web app that predicts the risk of Parkinson's Disease, Breast Cancer, Diabetes, and Heart Disease based on user input. It provides quick, reliable predictions and demonstrates skills in Python, ML, Pandas, Scikit-learn, and Streamlit.
